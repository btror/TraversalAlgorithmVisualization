# Traversal Algorithm Visualizer with A* 
GUI visualizing BFS and DFS traversal algorithms and different A* path finding implementations.

## How it Works
The gray square is where the algorithm begins it's search. It will keep searching until it reaches the green sqaure. Users can simply click on random spots of the grid and draw borders that the algorithm has to work around.
